# VIA-QMK-LED-Control
Piece of code to make the led of my keyboard The-Key-V2 blink orange when I debug in VS.  

# Le firmware
The firmware I used for the keyboard `drop_thekey_v2_vial.hex`.  
It can also be recompiled from the information contained in drop-thekey-v2-vial.zip.  
To flash the keyboard under Windows [qmk_toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases)(ATmega32U4).
